Project 2
================

I need to add two links: username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo
itself

[GitHub Pages Repo](https://brknapp.github.io/Project_1/) <br> [Regular
Repo](https://github.com/chsueh2/ST558-Project2)

For Project 2, I practiced summarizing data with an exploratory data
analysis (EDA), creating linear regression and ensemble tree-based
models, and automating Markdown reports.

# What Would I Do Differently?

At first, I struggled to do the EDA because I did not know where to
start or which variables to focus on. I began by making graphs that just
focused on one or two variables. I realized that I would need to do this
analysis for all of the variables (including the numeric and
categorical). At first, my EDA did not flow very well because it did not
tell a story about the entire data set. My partner helped me set up a
plan for my EDA, which helped it flow better (e.g., start with graphing
the response variable and then graph the rest of the variables). I then
learned how to make multiple graphs (one for each variable) at the same
time so that we could compare them. If I was able to do this part again,
I would start by planning out my EDA and deciding which variables to
visualize first. Then, I would prepare tables/graphs to explain each
variable.

# What was the Most Difficult Part?

The most difficult part of this project was understanding how to
automate this process. I remember learning how to do this in RMarkdown
in lecture by setting parameters and using the apply and render
functions. I was not sure how to apply this to GitHub. My partner showed
me how to do this with a function.
